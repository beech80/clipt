        <p className="mb-6">
          Welcome to Clipt! Clipt is a next-generation social media and streaming platform built on the principles of free expression, creativity, and gaming culture. By using Clipt, you agree to these Terms of Service ("Terms"). Please read them carefully.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold text-purple-300 mb-2">üîç Our Commitment to Freedom of Speech</h3>
          <p className="text-white/90">
            Unlike many other platforms, Clipt is built on the fundamental belief that users should be able to express themselves freely. We believe in minimal content moderation and maximum user expression, setting us apart from restrictive policies found on platforms like Twitch and YouTube. While we have basic rules to maintain safety and legality, we err on the side of allowing content rather than censoring it.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">

        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Who Can Use Clipt?</h2>

        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4.1 Our Philosophy on Free Speech</h3>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
          At Clipt, we believe in the fundamental right to free expression. Unlike other platforms that may restrict certain viewpoints or content, we aim to provide a space where diverse opinions and creative expression can flourish. We maintain only the minimum necessary content restrictions required by law.
        </p>

        <div className="bg-blue-900/10 border border-blue-700/30 rounded-lg p-4 my-4">
          <h4 className="font-medium text-blue-300 mb-2">How We're Different:</h4>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
            <li>We don't demonetize content based on controversial topics or opinions</li>
            <li>We don't algorithmically suppress content that challenges mainstream narratives</li>
            <li>We aim for transparent, consistent enforcement of our minimal rules</li>
            <li>We don't bow to external pressure to remove otherwise legal content</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        
        <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">4.2 What You Can Post</h3>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">

        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-2">
          To maintain a functional platform and comply with legal requirements, we have these minimal restrictions:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-none pl-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
          <li>üö´ Content that directly violates applicable laws (illegal content)</li>

        </ul>

        <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-4 mb-6">
          We believe adults should be able to choose what content they consume. We provide tools for users to filter content they don't wish to see, rather than removing content platform-wide.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">5. Copyright & Intellectual Property</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">

          <li>If you believe someone is using your content without permission, you can submit a DMCA takedown request.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">6. Live Streaming & Monetization</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
          <li>If you stream live, you are responsible for what you broadcast.</li>
          <li>Unlike other platforms, we do not demonetize content based on subjective criteria or advertiser pressure.</li>
          <li>If you earn money through Clipt (e.g., ads, tipping, or paid content), you must comply with our Monetization Policy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">7. Account Actions & Appeals</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">We may take action against accounts that:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
          <li>Violate the minimal restrictions outlined in section 4.3</li>
          <li>Engage in illegal activities</li>
          <li>Attempt to exploit or manipulate Clipt's systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-4">
          We believe in due process. Any action taken against an account will be accompanied by a clear explanation, and all users have the right to appeal decisions through our transparent appeals process.
